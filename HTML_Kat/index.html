  <h1>Hello, I'm Katherine Fernandez</h1>

  <p>I teach Visual Arts at Bronx Early College Academy. Most recently, I earned a certificate in User Experience Design at CUNY Techworks. Whether I am inside a classroom or out exploring a new neighborhood, I always engage in opportunities to learn. I take a logical and collaborative approach to the design process, prioritizing the user at every step. As a UX Designer, I aspire to learn how to build websites that will make life easier for the masses.
  </p>
  <p>I am interested in becoming a TKH Innovation Fellow because The Knowledge House(TKH) will provide me with the best training to become a full stack web developer. I like how TKH will help me gain real world product development experience and offer job search assistance. Technology provides a sense of structure for my artistic passions.
  </p>
  <p>I have a proven aptitude and drive to succeed in rigorous academic settings, and my sense of dedication allows me to rise to the occasion whenever the circumstances demands it. I understand that TKH attract the brightest and most driven students, and I know that I produce excellence when I am surrounded by excellence. I desire to be in an environment where I can both contribute and learn. I am thrilled by the prospect of joining your community and pursuing effective design solutions through web development.
